Requires
  Node.js (version >= 0.6.5)
  Coffeescript (version >= 1.1.3)

  You can download node at: http://nodejs.org/#download
  Coffee script can be installed thru npm once node is installed with:
    $ npm install -g coffee-script

You can run it with:

  Unix: $ bin/start.sh

  Windows: > bin/start.bat

  from the repository root folder. You can set the environment variable
  WEB_TABLETOP_ROOT to run from any folder.

  If the script has trouble running the coffee command, you should set the
  COFFEE environment variable to be the absolute path to the main coffee
  script (see npm's documentation for where it puts installed modules).
